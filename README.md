mni _(as in "mini")_ is a mostly unopinionated frontend framework built with simplicity and efficiency in mind. The main goal of mni is to eliminate unnecessary bloat in stylesheets and script caused by conventional frameworks.

## Work in progress

This is a WIP and not ready for use in production.

Detailed documentation will follow.
